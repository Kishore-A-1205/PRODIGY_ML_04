Hand Gesture Recognition Model
This repository contains a deep learning-based hand gesture recognition model designed to accurately identify and classify various hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems, enhancing user experiences in applications such as virtual reality, gaming, smart home devices, and more.

Features:
Accurate Recognition: Utilizes advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in recognizing a wide range of hand gestures.
Real-time Processing: Capable of processing video streams in real-time, providing immediate feedback and interaction.
Robust to Variations: Designed to handle variations in lighting, background, and hand positioning.
Extensible: Easily extendable to include new gestures and improve existing ones through transfer learning and data augmentation techniques.
Project Structure
